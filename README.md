# Other-Game-Projects-Portfolio
Here are some other games I've worked on (that have a public repository). Most games have an itch link on my portfolio, which you can view [here](https://kolakowskiwiktor.wixsite.com/wiktor-site)


### [Striking Hell](https://github.com/StudioAspen/AAAGame2023-2024)
- **Role:** Audio Programmer, Occasional Gameplay Programmer
- **Technologies:** Unity, C#
- **Description:** A 3D Platformer made by Studio Aspen, a group of roughly ~30 students from the EGD Collective of varying disciplines working together to make a single game over the course of a year. Ilm working in both the Programming team and the Design team. For Programming, I was basically the sole Audio developer for most of the project, much of my time was spent making the Audio Manager and ensuring everything Audio-related worked as needed. I also helped with occasional gameplay and other tasks when needed, particularly for the Rotating Slash Wall's functionality and creating a settings menu for the player to tweak their mouse sensitivity and audio settings.
- **Highlights:**
  - Designed and implemented the Audio Manager and other audio related systems
  - Helped create the Rotating Slash Wall's functionality
  - Created a settings menu for the player to tweak their mouse sensitivity and audio settings
 
### Miscellaneous Projects
- These are smaller projects I've worked on whose repository is currently private. Descriptions of them is available on my [portfolio website](https://kolakowskiwiktor.wixsite.com/wiktor-site), so I thought it'd be redundant to spend too much time on them
- **Joke's On You:** "Best Use of Theme" Winner for Global Game Jam at NYU Game Center. I acted as lead designer & programmer.
- **Chick Chase:** A simple High Score based game-jam game, tested the movement for "Balldyseus" here. I acted as lead designer & programmer
- **Opossum Ops:** Similar to Chick Chase but more level-oriented rather than high-score based.
- **Sling Bee:** Made for EGD x SGDA's weekend game jam. Won the Jam's Usability & Accessibility Award. I acted as the lead designer, though didn't do much for the programming.
- **Refold:** Winner of "Best Overall GSP Game" for EGD's Game Studio Program. I acted as the main designer and audio developer.
